Hello! This is my Animal Crossing Radio project for the specific purpose of listening to whatever corresponding hourly track it is
Here's the full list of features/whatever coding tricks I used to make this work

-Utilizing JavaScript's built in Date() library to access current system time
-Implementing the four main Animal Crossing games and all of their hourly tracks
-Basic JavaScript conditional operators and event listeners to change the source links every time the track ends
  -The track will check for an hour change after the track ends (usually about two or so minutes) or if the game is changed.
-A little bit of beautifying with some basic CSS
  -Custom font!! That's pretty neat as well

HOW TO USE:
  download source files, click radio.html, and select a game! The music will automatically start upon selection.
  from there, all you have to do is sit back and enjoy! there are onboard volume and playback speed controls, as well as a pause button. You have full control of the audio output :)
  
NONE OF THE MUSIC IS MINE! THIS IS ALL PROPERTY OF NINTENDO. I AM SIMPLY JUST A FAN OF THE SERIES WHO WANTED TO MAKE A COOL PROJECT BASED ON THEIR WORK.
